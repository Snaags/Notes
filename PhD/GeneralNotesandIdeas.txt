	-Agent trained to manage and allocate mutations rather than leaving it to random chance 
	 or even designing new networks from scratch based on successful models
	 	-sample --> validation data / format
	 	-lable  --> hyperparameters of high performing models

			-potential to be very broad 
			-seeder model? 


	-Combination of neuroevolution and back progagation (fine tuning done with back propagation for example)


	-Hyperparameter optimisation can be considered an infinite bandit problem since they are 
	 effectively infiniite configurations and an unknown reward for each
